# EDA on Adult Income

## Description
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the **Adult Income** dataset. The dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, contains demographic and income information. The goal is to explore the features, visualize trends, handle missing values, and derive insights about the factors that influence whether a person earns more or less than $50,000 per year.
